## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich brown (#654321) evoking chocolate's warmth and earthiness.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated version of the primary, offering a subtle, creamy backdrop.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFD700) to highlight key elements and create a sense of luxury and indulgence, as yellow is analogous to brown in the color wheel and this value has good contrast.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with a high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif to be paired with 'Playfair'.
- Use elegant, minimalist icons related to chocolate ingredients and flavors.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle 3D animations to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
